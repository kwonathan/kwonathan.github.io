                <p>Hello! I'm John Teyun Kwon, a DPhil candidate at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. The DPhil is part of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in <a href="https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/">Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems</a>, which encompasses research in machine learning, robotics & vision, cyber-physical systems, and control & verification.</p>
                <p>Currently, my research interest is in neural speech decoding. I'm supervised by Dr Oiwi Parker Jones at <a href="https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/homepage/">PNPL</a> within the <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford Robotics Institute</a>, where the aim of the lab is to apply deep learning techniques to large-scale non-invasive neural data to decode inner speech.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Most recently, I completed my research internship at the <a href="https://www.robot-learning.uk/">Robot Learning Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>. I worked on zero-shot trajectory generation capabilities of LLMs for robot manipulation tasks, supervised by Dr Edward Johns.</p>
                <p>Before that, I completed an MSc in Advanced Computing and an MSc in Computing Science, both at Imperial. I completed my undergraduate degree in Classics at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a>, where I was a <a href="https://www.cambridgetrust.org/">Cambridge Trust</a> Scholar.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing sports (football, squash and shooting), playing and listening to music, and all things art- and design-related (drawing, printmaking, photography, graphic design).</p>
